<h2>CosmoMC and GetDist with Planck Likelihood and Chains</h2>
</center>
<b>
Note: Planck 2015 likelihoods are not yet available (not sooner than mid-March), only the 2013 version. The Planck 2015 chains are however now available.
</b>
<P>
The Planck likelihood code (PLC/clik) and parameter chains are available from the <A HREF="http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/planck/pla">Planck Legacy Archive</A>.
<P>
<H3>Using the Planck 2013 likelihood with CosmoMC</H3>
Here I assume you have installed CosmoMC in a directory called COSMOMC..PATH, and will install the Planck likelihood code in a directory called PLC..PATH.
Note you need to use ifort 14 or higher to build CosmoMC, so make sure you have that configured before you start.
<UL>
<LI>Download and install the likelihood code and data files to somewhere convenient, probably not under cosmomc. These are the links (note things are likely to be updated and change, so apologies if not everything work exactly as stated here)
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/index.html#cosmology">Planck likelihood code and data download links</A> (select Release: PR1-2013, or see <A hREF="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/Planck/release_1/software/">US</A> site)
</UL>

<LI>Change to the plc_1.0  directory and do
<pre>bzip2 -d plc-1.0.tar.bz2; tar -xf plc-1.0.tar</pre>
<LI><pre>cd plc-1.0</pre>
<LI><pre>./waf configure --lapack_mkl=${MKLROOT} --lapack_mkl_version=10.3 --install_all_deps</pre>
  (you may need to change the options on this line depending on your installation; --install_all_deps may not be needed; see the .pdf document file in PLC..PATH/plc_1.0/plc_1.0 for options)
<LI><pre>./waf install</pre>
<LI>Edit your ~/.bashrc file to include
<pre>
export PLANCKLIKE=cliklike
export CLIKPATH=PLC..PATH/plc_1.0/plc_1.0
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CLIKPATH/lib
</pre>
Instead of the last item you can also use PLC's recommended <b>source PLC..PATH/plc_1.0/bin/clik_profile.sh</b>.
While you're at it you can add CosmoMC's python path (for plotting and quite analysis of chains):
<pre>
export PYTHONPATH=COSMOMC..PATH/python:$PYTHONPATH
</pre>
<LI>Change to your COSMOMC..PATH root directory and make a symbolic link to your PLC installation
<pre>
ln -s PLC..PATH/plc_1.0 ./data/clik
</pre>
(CosmoMC will look for files in ./data/clik - e.g. "ls -d ./data/clik/*.clik" should show you the likelihood data you downloaded).
<LI>Log out and in again to get the new settings,  then you can build cosmomc as described in the <A HREF="readme.html">ReadMe</A>.
</UL>
A set of .ini files are supplied in ./batch1 which set up standards for Planck runs. Location of data files is set in CAMspec_ACTSPT_defaults, CAMspec_defaults depending on what you want to use. You can try
<pre>mpirun -np 2 ./cosmomc test.ini</pre>
to see if things are being loaded and start running OK.
<P>
Note that the "highL" (ACT/SPT) likelihood file is not included in the first PLC download; hopefully it will be added soon. Meanwhile you can follow the instructions on the Planck likelihood download page for how to make it from the <A HREF="http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/act/act_fulllikelihood_get.cfm">ACT/SPT</A> download.
<P>
<A NAME="PlanckChains"></A>
<H3>Using Planck 2015 Chains</H3>
Planck provide a set of parameter chains produced by CosmoMC, available for download <A HREF="http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/#cosmology">here</a>; see <A HREF="http://wiki.cosmos.esa.int/planckpla2015/index.php/Cosmological_Parameters">description</A>.
<P>
You can use CosmoMC's python scripts and getdist to analyse and make plots from them. Check you have set the PYTHONPATH as described at the top of the <A hREF="readme_python.html">Python readme</A>.
<P>
Then download and extract all the chain data. Make a symbolic link from ./cosmomc/PLA to the location of the chains, e.g.
<PRE>
ln -s PLA..PATH ./PLA
</PRE>
so that ./PLA/base is for example the head directory with the baseline model chains (and PLA..PATH is the full path that you extracted the contents of the download to).
For the program to know about the structure of the grid you first need to initialize it for the location you have installed in. Do
<PRE>
python python/makeGrid.py PLA
</PRE>
You can now use python, grid and plotting scripts on the PLA directory, and they will know about the available data.
Grid configuration settings for the Planck parameter grid are in PLA/config/.
<P>
If you download multiple Planck 2015 chain bundles, extract them to the same location so new folders are just merged over the existing ones and run makeGrid.py again, then plotting scripts etc will find
all the results. If you want to use the +BKP tensor chains, download and add them last, so the config folder matches that in the BKP download.
<P>
You can also configure the plotting scripts to use the PLA location as the <b>default_grid_root</b>  (esp. if you want to run or adapt sample plot scripts under batch2/outputs/).
Make a text file called <b>python/getdist/config.ini</b> and add setting lines as required,e.g.
<pre>
default_grid_root =  PLA..PATH
cache_dir = PLA..PATH/cache
output_base_dir=
</pre>
Setting <b>use_plot_data = F</b> means that you do not need to run getdist first, anything needed for plotting will be calculated on the fly.
The <b>cache_dir</b> is used to cache python-format chains, which makes loading them much faster after the first time.
By default, plots go into ./outputs directory under cosmomc. You can se the <b>output_base_dir</b> to another location is where plot output (e.g. pdf) files are put by default
(in output_base_dir/outputs).

<H4>Plotting</H4>

You can use the <A HREF="readme_gui.html">GetDist GUI</A> to load the PLA folder location and then open and plot chains as you wish.
Or you can write your own python scripts to plot things of interest; many examples are in <b>batch2/outputs/</b>.
Make sure you have set up your python/getdist/config.ini as described above with default file location.
<P>
For example, to run the sample scripts, you can do
<pre>
python batch2/outputs/lensonly_direction.py
</pre>
to reproduce the figure above. (assuming you downloaded and installed the full PLA chain grid; default output location is ./outputs).
<P>
For instructions on writing plotting scripts, or how to calculate new derived parameters, see the <A HREF="readme_python.html">plotting and analysis scripts</A> readme.
