# IMPORTANT NOTES REGARDING smooth_scale_1D:
# BKPlanck: The choice of the smooth_scale_1D has impact on the likelihood of r for r->0
# since the smoothing kernel is asked to smooth over the cut-off at r=0. This results in
# and artifical increase of the likelihood towards r=0. Choose a small smoothing scale
# to be closer to the underlying MCMC sample distribution:
smooth_scale_1D = 0.0625
# if >= 1 smooth by smooth_scale_1D bin widths
# if > 0  and <1 smooth by Gaussian of smooth_scale_1D standard deviations in each parameter (around 0.2-0.3 is often good)
# if < 0 uses automatic smoothing length (changes with parameter)
# -the overall smoothing length is scaled by abs(smooth_scale_1D) from very crude guess at best overall scale
