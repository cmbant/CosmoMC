# BICEP2/Keck Array/Planck joint likelihood
# 
# The file contains the input parameters to CosmoMC to reproduce the
# likelihoods of the variations to the fiducial analysis
# Using only 150 and 353 GHZ
# See Section III C and Figure 7 of A Joint Analysis of BICEP2/Keck Array and Planck Data
# using CosmoMC release Jan 2015
#
# For details of the setup see BKPlanckonly.ini and BKPlanck.ini
# and comments therein.
#
# Note: Once the chains are created, use the BKPlanck_04_no217_dist.ini as input to
#       CosmoMC's getdist to produce smooth likelihoods.
