# BICEP2/Keck Array likelihood, including external data from Planck and WMAP.
#
# This file contains input parameters to CosmoMC to reproduce the likelihoods of the 
# alternate analysis with dust-sync correlation fixed to 0.2 from Figure 17 of 
# BICEP2/Keck VI.
# For details of the parameters in the baseline model, see BK14only.ini and BK14.ini, 
# and comments therein.
#
# After generating chains, BK14_06_fixcorr_dist.ini can be used with getdist to 
# produce plots of marginalized posteriors.
